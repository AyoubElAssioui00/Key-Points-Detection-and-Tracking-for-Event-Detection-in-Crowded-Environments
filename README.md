  This project presents a detailed overview of a key points detection and tracking system
developed for the analysis of dynamic scenes, particularly focused on event detection in
crowd environments. The system integrates various methodologies such as Harris Corner
Detection, optical flow tracking, and models for both magnitude and direction, to capture
the movement and interactions of key points within a video. Through a structured ap-
proach that involves detection, tracking, and grouping, the system is designed to handle
the complexity of real-world scenarios, where the goal is to identify and analyze signifi-
cant events in crowded scenes. 

  The **report** attached explores the theoretical foundations of the key
methods used, the architecture of the implementation, and the results obtained through
various stages of the process.
